<p>Dynamic Dao is JDBC ORM framework. It allows to use annotations to attach SQL execution to
    interface methods.</p>

<b>It takes care of 3 things:</b>

<ol>
    <li>Binds method arguments to query parameters</li>
    <li>Executes SQL statement</li>
    <li>Maps statement's result set to method's return type</li>
</ol>

<p>From developer's prospective it feels like instead of writing method body you just write SQL
    statement. Here is
    example:</p>

<pre>
                        JNDIDao("db/testdb")
                        public interface TestDao {
                            @Select("select id, name from users where id = #1#")
                            UserBean getUser(int id);
                        }
                    </pre>
<p>Here is the code that illustrates how to use this dao:</p>

<pre>
                        ALinker factory = new ALinker();
                        TestDao dao = factory.create(TestDao.class);
                        UserBean res = dao.getUser(1);
                    </pre>
